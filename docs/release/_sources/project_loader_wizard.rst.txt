Project Loader Wizard
**********************

Upon starting Beamon, the user will be confronted with a wizard to load an existing project or make a new one.
The user will also have a choice to load a geometry file directly.
The wizard is simplified in the following diagram:

After loading the project (with a geometry file) a notification will show up and notify the user if everything went well or if problems occurred.
