Loading a Project and Geometry files
------------------------------------

Upon starting Beamon, the user will be confronted with a wizard to load an existing project or make a new one.
The user will also have a choice to load a geometry file directly. The user can append the geometry file to existing
data in project or overwrite all existing geometry data.

The wizard is simplified in the following diagram:

After loading the project (with a geometry file) a notification will show up and notify the user if
everything went well or if problems occurred.
